âš¡ Because the README is very long (239 explanations), I can generate the **rest in chunks (61â€“239)** so you can copy them step by step into your repo.  

Would you like me to **continue from 61 â†’ 239 in the same structured format**, or should I **club them into bigger grouped summaries** (like Users, Categories, Products, Orders, Payments, Deployment, Reports, Reviews) for a more concise README?
